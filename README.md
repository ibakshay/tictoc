### tictoc
I  modelled a network of two nodes, in which one node is Tic and the other node is Toc. The two nodes are Communicating with each other by sending packets (1000 packets) with fixed propagation delay and random processing delay for both Tic and Toc. I have used Uniform random generator to generate randomness. The sequence number will also be appended to each packet and it is presented in the simulation. And finally, I calculated RTT and shown in the form of a graph. Random delay generated for tic and toc is plotted in the graph. After running the simulation multiple times, I Tested RTT for the random packet as well as the mean of all the packets obtained from the results and verified it. In the generated  report graphs, Tic Processing delay, Toc Processing delay and the RTT of the network is successfully captured for 1000 packets.
